Upload Fight Prediction Project

This commit includes the initial upload of the Fight Prediction project. The project focuses on predicting outcomes in fights using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, providing a diverse and comprehensive set of data for analysis.

Key Points:
- Implemented machine learning models for fight outcome prediction.
- Utilized a Kaggle dataset for training and evaluation.

This project is a result of the combined efforts and collaboration of the team, leveraging Kaggle's rich resources to enhance the quality of our predictions.
